# ProjektLaravel
Project to learning Laravel (and PHP). It will hand-held(with filtering of data to displaing) generator of reports from excel file (user must-by the use of a browser e.g. in the Intranet- to regiser, log in and than enters his .xls file; Next he chooses data for visualisation from columns and rows of excel and the application draws charts. When he logging out excel's data will removed from the database). Application must to have architecture according to MVC pattern and must to provide data security of user. At the beginning I made this: Installing laravel-framework and additional components (Composer);checking php version,
checking enviroment path in WindowsSystem, installing composer and laravel/ui pack (there steps are described in Laravel documentacion for 7x version).

My idea is to download bootstrap theme with ready charts and to changing its according to this plan( as agreed - quenes of littler tasks in the project) My ProjectLaravel: -php version 8.0 -Laravel version 8.41.1 -Composer version 2.1.3 -laravel/ui 3.3 -npm version 6.14.13
